# ðŸ¥Š UFC Fight Predictor

This project helped me learn **Python for machine learning** while applying it to something I enjoy: **UFC**. I built a model to predict fight winners based on fighter stats and tested it on **Jon Jones vs. Tom Aspinall**. During this process I learned to write Pythhon code interactively using Jupyter Notebook, handle fight data using NumPy and Pandas, train a model using RandomforestClassifier, used Matplotlib to plot out the most significant fight statistics to visualize what statistics predicts the winner of a fighter the best.

The following link will bring you to a Jupyter Notebook Viewer that will render the notebook and display it for you to view
